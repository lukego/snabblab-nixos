# Report on basic, iperf, and l2fwd

This report makes a basic comparison of how several Snabb versions perform. The benchmarks used are "end to end" functional tests. Only one set of software versions are considered for the dependencies used in test cases (QEMU, Linux kernel, DPDK).

Benchmarks:

* `basic` is a simple synthetic benchmark (also known as `snabbmark basic1`). This exercises basic app network processing such as allocating and freeing packets, transfers between ring buffers, and executing the apps.
* `l2fwd` measures the throughput in packets per second when looping packets from a physical network through a Linux virtual machine running the DPDK `l2fwd` example program. Each packet is received from the network, forwarded to the VM, received from the VM, and sent back onto the network. The score shows the number of packets that complete the loop.
* `iperf` measures the throughput in gigabits per second when connecting two VMs via one Snabb process. The VMs run an iperf client and server respectively. The Snabb process forwards each packet from one VM to the other and performs checksum offloading.

## Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error = TRUE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
dat <- read.csv("bench.csv")
d <- as.data.frame(dat)
# "sliced" is the dataset with unwanted configurations and software versions excluded
sliced <- subset(d, subset=(benchmark == "basic" | (kernel == "3.18.29" & qemu == "2.4.1" & (is.na(config) | config == "base") & (is.na(dpdk) | dpdk == "16.04"))))
```

## Line graph

[Line graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph) for a simple and direct look at the results. The Y-scale starts at 0 to put the absolute differences in perspective.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(sliced, aes(y=score, x=id, color=snabb))
p <- p + theme(legend.position="top")
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + geom_line()
p <- p + expand_limits(y=0)
p <- p + facet_wrap(~ benchmark, scales = "free")
p + ggtitle("Sequential test results")
```

## Box plot

[Box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) to summarize the distribution of results. The Y-axis origin is free to put focus on the relative differences.
```{r}
p <- ggplot(sliced, aes(x=id, y=score, color=snabb))
p <- p + theme(legend.position="top")
p <- p + geom_boxplot(alpha=0.50)
p <- p + facet_wrap(~ benchmark, scales = "free")
p + ggtitle("Summary of test results")
```

## Density plot

[Density plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation) showing the distribution of results. The curve is high around common values and low around rare values. Here we can see how spread out they are, how they cluster together, etc.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(sliced, aes(score, fill = snabb, color = snabb))
p <- p + theme(legend.position="top")
p <- p + geom_density(alpha = 0.1)
p <- p + facet_wrap(~ benchmark, ncol=1, scales = "free")
p + ggtitle("Shape (distribution) of test results")
```

## ECDF

[Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function) shows the proportion of values that are above a threshold.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(sliced, aes(score, color = snabb))
p <- p + theme(legend.position="top")
p <- p + stat_ecdf()
p <- p + facet_wrap(~ benchmark, ncol=1, scales = "free")
p <- p + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1), labels=scales::percent, breaks=seq(0, 1, 0.1))
p + ggtitle("Cumulative distribution of results")
```
